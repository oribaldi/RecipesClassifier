<ti>Chinese Chicken Chunks with Peanuts in Spicy</ti>

<in>3 cups peanut oil</in>
<in>2 whole chicken breasts at room temperature</in>
<in>1 large egg white</in>
<in>1 1/2 tablespoons water chestnut flour</in>
<in>SAUCE:</in>
<in>4 green onions</in>
<in>2 large cloves garlic</in>
<in>1 tablespoon minced ginger root</in>
<in>1/2 cup chicken stock</in>
<in>1/2 tablespoon sesame oil</in>
<in>1/2 tablespoon Chinese red vinegar</in>
<in>1/2 tablespoon dark soy sauce</in>
<in>1 1/2 level teaspoons chilli paste with garlic</in>
<in>1 tablespoon dry sherry</in>
<in>1 pinch sugar</in>
<in>cornstarch paste</in>
<pr>Trim ends off green onions and cut light green and white part into 1 inch sections. Mix all other sauce ingredients in a 2 quart saucepan.  Reserve. Remove skin and bones from chicken breasts.  Slice meat into 1 inch strips, then crosswise to make 1 inch chunks. In a bowl large enough to hold chicken, add egg white to water chestnut flour.  Beat mixture with a single chopstick (not an egg beater or whisk).  Stir chicken pieces into egg mixture and coat thoroughly.  Marinate for 5 minutes.  Note: water chestnut flour gives a lighter crust than cornstarch, though the latter may be substituted. Heat cooking oil in a wok or deep-fryer to medium heat (more oil will be needed if using deep-fryer).  Fry peanuts until they are a light tan color; if a test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat.  Remove peanuts with strainer or a slotted spoon; drain on paper towel or paper bag.  Reserve. Turn up heat slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk first: chicken should raise to surface immediately and brown in about 2 minutes.  Deep-fry coated chicken chunks until golden brown.  Deep-fry no more than 8 chunks at a time.  Use long chopsticks or a spatula to keep pieces separate while they are frying.  Remove with long chopsticks or a slotted spoon.  Reserve. While deep-frying chicken, heat sauce to simmer.  Add green onions and peanuts for about 1 minute, before serving.  Add chicken pieces to sauce, mix quickly and serve.</pr>

<in>1 teaspoon salt</in>
<in>1/2 teaspoon thyme</in>
<in>1/2 teaspoon oregano</in>
<in>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</in>
<in>1 pinch ground cloves</in>
<pr>Yield: 12 servings This two step cooking procedure ensures the removal of most of the fat. Combine ground pork and cracker crumbs.  Stir in water, sage, salt, thyme, oregano, pepper and cloves.  Mix until thoroughly combined. Divide mixture into 12 portions.  Form each portion into a sausage-shaped roll or flat patty.  (Wet hands with cold water to make the job easier.) Place in a cold, lightly oiled frypan.  Cook over a medium heat, turning often, for about 4 minutes each side until just beginning to brown and pieces are no longer pink. Remove and place on paper towels and blot to absorb any fat.  Wrap. Store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 2 months.  Or cook a second time and serve immediately. To serve:  Return sausages or patties to a clean, cold frypan.  Cook over a medium heat, turning once or twice, for about 4 minutes or until sausages are brown and crisp. Cook frozen sausages in the same manner, allowing about 2 minutes longer for cooking. PORK PIES:  cook ground pork mixture in a frying pan, place it in a plastic colander to drain off fat and blot with paper towels.  Spread the pork mixture in an 8 inch pyrex baking dish, add fat free gravy if needed for liquid.  Top with 2 1/4 cups seasoned breadcrumbs.  Bake at 350 to 375 degrees F until crumbs are lightly browned.</pr>

<in>1 ts Paprika</in>
<in>1/2 ts Salt</in>
<in>1/2 ts Freshly Ground Black Pepper</in>
<pr>When the fire has burned down to hot coals, spread to provide moderate heat and fit a drip pan in front of in the center of the coals. Place the brisket, fat side up, over the drip pan. Cover the grill and adjust the dampers to maintain slow steady heat. While the meat is cooking, in a sauce pan combine all of the other ingredients, blending well, and simmer for 10 minutes. After 1 hour, baste the meat lightly with the sauce and turn the meat as needed to cook evenly. Replenish the fire as needed, but don't pile the coals, as the brisket should cook slowly. Cook 4 to 5 hours total until the meat almost falls apart. Sprinkle 2 to 3 handfuls of hickory chips, that have been soaked in water, over the coals. Cover the grill or enclose the top of the meat in a sheet of foil, tucked around the bottom edges of the meat and let the hickory smoke the meat for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the cover and brush the meat with the sauce. Place the meat on a platter and slice. It will crumble. Serve the meat and the remaining sauce on split and buttered sandwich buns. Any leftover sandwiches can be frozen and reheated in a microwave or conventional oven, or the shredded meat and sauce can be frozen together to reheat later for sandwiches.</pr>

Slowly add cold water, 1 teaspoon at a time, tossing with fork until flour is moistened without being wet. Gather dough with moist hands, shape into flattened round and let rest about 15 minutes. Roll 1/8-inch thick on lightly floured board. (To facilitate rolling, dough may also be rolled between sheets of wax paper or unrolled dough may be placed in pan and gently pressed to cover inside of pan.) Gently lift and press onto 9-inch square tart pan with removable bottom. Cut off dough edges. Bake at 425 degrees F. 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. The use of oat flour blend and cake flour is what gives this low-fat crust its tenderness. It also makes it more difficult to roll, but don't despair: The dough is easily patched.</pr>

<in>200 g Sugar</in>
<in>3 Tblsp Grand Marnier or Cointreau</in>
<in>2 Tblsp Grenadine syrup</in>
<pr>Oranges a l'orientale: Peel the zest from the oranges in long strips, taking as  little of the pith as possible. Cut the zest into very, very fine julienne strips. Remove the pith in vertical strips to expose the flesh of the oranges. Then, holding the oranges over a strainer with a bowl beneath to catch all the  juice, cut each segment away from the membranes that divide one from another, and  from the central core of pith. Squeeze all the discarded membranes to extract every drop of juice, if any flesh  remains on them, and add it to the already collected juice. Blanch the julienned zest in bouling water for 1 minute. Refresh in cold water and drain in a sieve. Put the sugar into a large, wide saucepan and cook over a moderate, steady heat  until the sugar melts and becomes a light golden color. Add the collected orange juice and, stirring to mix well, cook until the liquid has  the consistency of a light syrup. Add the julienned zest to the sysrup, as well as  the liqueur and the grenadine syrup. If a scum forms, remove it with a spoon as if you were making jam. Bring it briefly to the boil. Add the orange segments and shake the pan well so that they all absorb the syrup.  They should be hot, but they should not be allowed to cook. Set the pan aside. Add another drop of liqueur to the pan. Arrange the segments on four plates to look like stars. Coat them with the sysrup  and decorate with the julienned zests. Serve the oranges in a fruit dish, with a selection of some other fruit desserts.</pr>

Process 10 min in boiling water bath. Store in a cool, dark, dry place. Serve with ham, lamb, gingerbread, muffins, pancakes. My note: Original directions called for apples to be chopped and cooked with cores and peels. After discarding what looked like a lot of apple sauce stuck to the peel and picking bits of seeds out of my teeth, I would suggest cooking the peels and cores separately to get some apple juice.</pr>

To assemble the lasagne, pour a little sauce in the bottom of a 9 x 13 inch baking dish.  Cover with a layer of noodles, then a layer of sauce.  Sprinkle a layer of Provolone, a layer of Mozzarella, then a layer of Parmesan cheese.  Cover with a layer of noodles, then sauce, then the ricotta cheese mixture.  Top with a layer of noodles, sauce and grated cheeses.  Finish with a layer of noodles, sauce and grated cheese.  Cover the lasagne lightly (if using aluminium foil, make a tent with the foil so it does not touch the top of the lasagne). Bake for 1 hour at 350 F.  Remove the cover and bake for an additional 30 minutes.  Allow lasagne to set for 10 minutes before serving.  This lasagne will be quite firm and can be served in neat squares.</pr>

<pr>STARTER:  Prepare 4 days in advance of bread making.  Combine 1 package yeast, 2 cups warm water and 2 cups all-purpose flour in a plastic bowl or container.  Cover tightly and let stand for 2 days at room temperature. Refrigerate for at least another day (see note below). The day before preparing the dough, combine 1 cup of starter, rye flour and 1 cup warm water in a bowl.  Cover with plastic wrap and let stand overnight at room temperature.  The next day, stir down the dough and add the second package of yeast, dissolved in 1/4 cup warm water, salt, caraway seeds, poppy seeds, butter and sugar.  Add up to 4 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup at a time, to make a stiff, but workable dough.  Knead for 10 to 12 minutes, and shape into a ball.  Place in a buttered bowl, turning to coat the dough with butter.  Cover and let rise in a warm, draft free place, until doubled in size, about two hours.  Punch down and divide the dough in half.

<ti>Pirohi Dough and Fillings</ti>
<in>PIROHI DOUGH:</in>
<in>potato water, no salt</in>
<in>4 large eggs, beaten</in>
<in>4 to 5 lb. flour</in>
<in>CHEESE FILLING:</in>
<in>1 lb. potted cheese</in>
<in>1 cup sweet cream</in>
<in>1 large egg</in>
<in>salt</in>
<in>PRUNE FILLING:</in>
<in>large dried prunes</in>
<in>POTATO FILLING:</in>
<in>3 large potatoes</in>
<in>onion mixture</in>
<in>CABBAGE FILLING:</in>
<in>1 can sauerkraut (squeeze out the juice)</in>
<in>vegetable oil</in>
<in>1 head cabbage</in>
<in>1 cup mashed potatoes</in>
<in>salt</in>
<pr>PIROHI DOUGH:  Mix together ingredients.  Knead until hard enough to roll out, like a pie crust.  Over kneading will make it tough.  Roll out, not too thick or thin.  Cut into squares.  All fillings should be cold when placed in the center of the square.  Fold dough in half to form a triangle.  Tuck in corners and pinch edges together.  Keep fingers dry. When all of the pirohi are made, drop a few at a time into a pot of salted boiling water.  Cook for 3 or 4 minutes, they should rise to the top of the water when cooked.  Remove pirohi from pot and place in cold water.  Remove immediately.  Dry on a cloth or brush with butter to prevent them from sticking together.  They may be frozen when dry. Place in a pan with a little water.  Cover with foil and warm in an oven.  When warm, pour butter or onion mixture on top and serve. CABBAGE:  Shred and scald cabbage and put in pot of cold water; cook until almost boiling; drain.  Fry cabbage and sauerkraut in oil until golden, for about 3 or 4 minutes.  Mix potatoes and salt with cabbage mixture.  The potato flavor cannot be tasted; it holds the mixture together. CHEESE:  Blend enough cream with the other ingredients to hold it together. PRUNES:  Cook prunes until tender.  Remove pits.  Roll in sugar before placing in pirohi. POTATOES:  Boil potatoes in unsalted water.  Save water for the dough.  Mash and mix with onion mixture.</pr>

<in>NUT FILLING:</in>
<in>2 Egg whites</in>
<in>1/2 c Caster sugar</in>
<in>2 c Coarsely ground walnuts</in>
<in>2 c Coarsely ground almonds</in>
<in>1 tsp Rose water</in>
<in>ALTAR SYRUP:</in>
<in>2 c Granulated sugar</in>
<in>1 1/2 c Water</in>
<in>1 tsp Lemon juice</in>
<in>1 tsp Orange flower water</in>
<in>1 tsp Rose water</in>
<pr>Stack 10 sheets phyllo on a flat surface, keeping remainder covered with a dry,  then a damp tea towel. Brush top sheet of stack with butter, lift sheet and replace on stack buttered side  down. Brush top with butter, lift top two sheets and turn over on stack. Repeat until all 10 sheets are buttered, lifting an extra sheet each time. Top and bottom of finished stack should remain unbuttered. With kitchen scissors cut buttered stack of phyllo into approximately 10 cm (4'')  squares. Stack and cover. Prepare remainder of phyllo. Depending on size of phyllo sheets, you may have fewer than 10 left at the end.  Halve sheets if necessary to give 10 layers. Beat egg whites until stiff and beat sugar in gradually. Fold in nuts and rose water. Butter top of phyllo square and place a Tblsp of nut mixture in the centre. Gently squeeze into a lily shape, with four corners of square as petals and filling  in centre. Place in a buttered 25 x 33 cm (10 x 13 inch) baking dish. Repeat with remaining ingredients, placing finished pastries close together in  dish. Bake in moderate oven for 30 minutes, reduce to slow and cook for further 15 min. Meanwhile dissolve sugar in water over heat, add lemon juice and orange water and  bring to the boil. Boil for 15 minutes, stir in rose water and cool. Spoon cool thick syrup over hot pastries. Leave until cool and sprinkle pistachio nuts in centres of pastries if desired. If you are not used to work with phyllo pastry, then it is advisable to fill and  shape the first lot of buttered squares before going onto the nest lot. The butter firms fairly quickly and it could be difficult to shape the pastries if  the buttered sheets are left for a time.</pr>

<ti>STOLLEN</ti>
<in>1/2 c Chopped candied citron</in>
<in>1/4 c Chopped candied angelica</in>
<in>1/2 c Golden raisins</in>
<in>:Boiling water</in>
<in>8 tb Butter</in>
<in>2 pk Dry yeast</in>
<in>1 c Milk; warmed</in>
<in>1 ts Salt</in>
<in>2 Eggs; slightly beaten</in>
<in>2/3 c Granulated sugar</in>
<in>1/2 ts Mace</in>
<in>1/4 ts Ground cardamom</in>
<in>5 1/2 c All-purpose flour (about)</in>
<in>3/4 c Chopped blanched almonds</in>
<in>2 tb Confectioners' sugar</in>
<pr>PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Combine the citron, angelica and raisins in a small bowl, pour boiling water over to cover, then stir and let stand. Melt the butter and let cool to lukewarm. Sprinkle the yeast over the milk in a large bowl, stir, and let stand a few minutes to dissolve. Add the salt, eggs, butter, granulated sugar, mace and cardamom, and mix well. Add 2 cups of the flour and beat vigorously until smooth. Add 3 more cups flour, 1 cup at a time, beating well after each. After adding the last cup, beat until the dough holds together in a shaggy ball. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for a minute or 2, sprinkling on more flour if necessary to keep it from being too sticky. Let rest for 10 minutes. Drain the fruits and raisins in a strainer and press firmly to remove excess water. Sprinkle the fruit and nuts over the dough, and resume kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic. Add a little more flour as necessary to keep it from being too sticky. Place in a greased bowl, and turn the dough about to coat all surfaces. Cover and let rise until double in bulk. (This dough is especially rich, and the first rise might take as long as 3 hours, depending on the temperature of your kitchen.) Punch the dough down and divide in half. Shape and pat each piece into an oval about 10 inches long and 4 1/2 inches at the widest part. Fold almost in half the long way, bringing the upper edge only about 2/3 of the way over, so the bottom edge extends beyond the top. Place the loaves on a greased baking sheet, leaving several inches between them. Cover lightly and let rise for 45 minutes. Bake in a preheated 350F oven for about 40 to 45 minutes, until nicely browned. Remove from the oven and dust with the confectioners' sugar sprinkled through a sieve, then transfer to racks to cool.</pr>

<pr>Yield: 8 servings In a 6 to 8 quart pan over high heat, stir milk, sugar and cardamom until simmering. Over medium to high heat, boil until reduced to 2 cups, for 25 to 35 minutes, stirring often. Slide pan partially off heat if the milk threatens to boil over.  Let cool; to speed cooling, place pan in iced water. Place paper cups in a rimmed pan.  Or, to make cones, cut 8 pieces of parchment or waxed paper into 7 1/2 inch squares. Fold each piece in half to make a triangle.  With the long edge toward you, bring one of the 45( angles to the top of the triangle, then roll toward the other angle.  To close the hole at the bottom, starting from the top, press one inside sheet to the opposite side. Tape the cone in a few places to hold it together. Support each cone, pointed end down, in a cup slightly taller than the cone; set cups in a rimmed pan. Divide milk mixture amongst cups or cones.

<in>1/2 cup superfine sugar</in>
<in>1 egg yolk</in>
<in>1 pinch salt</in>
<in>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</in>
<in>2 tablespoons heavy cream</in>

<in>2 teaspoons instant coffee</in>
<in>5 1/3 tablespoons butter</in>
<in>1 1/2 tablespoons corn syrup</in>
<in>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</in>
<in>2 tablespoons heavy cream</in>
<pr>Have ready a clean, lint-free, dish towel and cookie sheet larger than a jelly roll pan. Preheat oven to 400 F. Grease a 10 x 15 x 1 inch jelly roll pan, lining bottom and sides with wax paper and grease wax paper. Bring eggs to room temperature and separate. Mix flour, baking powder and salt; set aside. Beat yolks until thick and pale.  Gradually add 6 tablespoons sugar, beating well after each addition.  The mixture should fall in thick ribbons when beaters are lifted.  Add vanilla and beat again. With clean, dry beaters, beat egg whites until foaming.  Gradually add remaining sugar, beating constantly, until whites stand in firm, glossy, moist peaks.  Fold 1/3 egg whites into egg yolk mixture to lighten it; fold in remaining egg whites.  Gradually fold dry ingredients gently into egg mixture. Spread batter evenly in the prepared pan, making sure to get it into the corners.  Put pan into oven immediately. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until cake is golden on top and tester comes out clean.  Do not overbake.  Remove from oven. Working quickly, cover jelly roll pan with a clean towel, then with inverted cookie sheet.  Turn over.  Remove jelly roll pan; peel off wax paper.  Slide towel and cake onto counter; cake is wrong-side up.  Cut off any crisp edges, fold one end of towel over short end of cake, and roll cake in towel.  Place rolled cake seam-side down on wire rack or cookie sheet to cool completely. CHESTNUT BUTTERCREAM FILLING:  Combine sugar, egg yolk, salt, vanilla and cream; beat for 8 minutes at medium speed.  Without washing beaters, cream butter until light.  Add yolk mixture, a little at a time, beating well after each addition.  Gradually add powdered sugar, beating well after each addition.  Set aside. Puree chestnuts with butter, cream and powdered sugar.  Stir chestnut puree into buttercream mixture, blending thoroughly.  If necessary, thin with a little more cream to bring to a spreadable consistency. MOCHA SILK FROSTING:  Powder instant coffee by placing in a plastic bag and crushing with rolling pin.  Mix together sugar, cocoa and coffee.  Add remaining ingredients and beat for 1 minute at medium speed.  If necessary, add a little more cream to make frosting easy to spread. Unroll cooled cake, leaving it on the towel.  Spread 1/2 cup frosting evenly over cake to the edges.  Spread 2 cups filling over thin layer of frosting, pushing a generous amount into curved end.  Roll up again, without towel, but using it to help roll.  Place cake, seam-side down, on cake plate or tray.  Remove any excess filling from ends and seam edge.  Refrigerate for 1 hour to firm filling. Trim and discard a thin slice from one end of the chilled cake; cut and reserve wedge from the other end.  Spread a small amount of filling on top center of cake and press reserved wedge on it to make the "knothole."  Frost the entire cake with remaining frosting, building frosting up around sides of "knothole."  Do not cover knothole top!  Work frosting as far under roll as possible.  Repeatedly draw the narrow metal spatula lengthwise through frosting to simulate the rough texture of bark.  Snip pieces of angelica into leaf shapes and cut glace cherries in half to make log decorations. Keep cake refrigerated until serving; it is much easier to slice when cold and firm.  Before serving, surround cake with holly and cranberries.</pr>

<ti>Vegetable Soup</ti>
<in>8 cups chicken broth</in>
<in>1/3 cup olive oil</in>
<in>1/4 cup chopped parsley</in>
<in>4 cloves garlic</in>
<in>1/4 lb. pancetta or unsmoked bacon</in>
<in>3 cups shredded cabbage</in>
<in>1 medium onion, chopped finely</in>
<in>2 carrots, chopped finely</in>
<in>1 celery stalk, chopped finely</in>
<in>1 potato, peeled and chopped</in>
<in>2 zucchinis, chopped finely</in>
<in>1 large tomato, chopped</in>
<in>1/4 lb. mushrooms, chopped finely</in>

<in>4 pieces prosciutto rind</in>
<in>salt, to taste</in>
<in>pepper, to taste</in>
<in>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</in>
<pr>Yield: 8 to 10 servings Pancetta is the same cut of pork as bacon.  It is cured with salt and is not smoked.  It comes rolled-up, like a large salami.  Widely used in Italian cooking, it is vital to many dishes.  If available, buy a large quantity.  Cut into several pieces and freeze.  Domestic bacon can be substituted for pancetta.  It must be blanched in boiling water for two to three minutes to reduce the smoky flavor.  Fresh, side pork can also be used. Prepare chicken broth. Heat oil in a large saucepan.  Add parsley and garlic.  Saute over a medium heat.  Before garlic changes color, add pancetta.  Saute until lightly browned.  Stir in cabbage.  Cover and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add remaining vegetables to the saucepan.  Cover and cook for about 5 minutes. Add broth and water, if using, and prosciutto rind or ham shank.  Cover and reduce heat.  Simmer for 40 to 50 minutes.  Remove half the vegetables with a slotted spoon. Place in a blender or food processor and process until smooth.  Return to saucepan.  Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot with Parmesan cheese sprinkled over the top. Toast about 20 thick slices of Italian bread.  Place 2 slices in each soup bowl and sprinkle generously with Parmesan cheese.  Ladle soup into bowls.  Serve with additional Parmesan cheese.</pr>

<ti>Apple Pie In Cheddar Crust</ti>
<in>2 c Unbleached Flour; sifted</in>
<in>1 1/4 c Cheddar; Md, shredded</in>
<in>1/2 ts Salt</in>
<in>2/3 c Vegetable Shortening</in>
<in>Water; Iced</in>
<in>7 c Apples; tart cooking ie. Granny Smiths, cored, pared and thinly sliced</in>
<in>1/2 c Sugar</in>
<in>2 tb Unbleached Flour</in>
<in>1/2 ts Cinnamon; ground</in>
<in>2 tb Butter OR Regular Margarine</in>
<in>1 Egg Yolk; Lg, Beaten</in>
<in>1 tb Water</in>
<pr>CHEDDAR CRUST: Combine the flour, cheese and salt in a bowl. Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut in the shortening until coarse crumbs form. Sprinkle the iced water (5 or 6 tbls will be needed) and using a fork, toss the crumbs until a dough is formed. Press the dough firmly into a ball. FILLING: Divide the pastry almost in half and roll out the larger half, on a lightly floured surface, to a 13-inch circle. Line a 9-inch pie plate with the pastry, trimming the edges to 1/2inch beyond the rim of the pie plate. (When lining the pie plate, be careful not to stretch the pastry when spreading it out. This will cause holes or the pastry will shrink and the filling will run over in the oven as it is baked. Place in the pie plate and gently, working from the center, spread the pastry out until it covers the bottom of the pie plate and then lay the rest of the pastry over the rim and trim.) Combine the apples, sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a bowl, mixing well. Arrange the apple mixture in the pastry lined pie plate. Roll out the remaining pastry to an 11-inch circle. Gently fold into quarters and cut steam slits in the folds. Unfold the crust and place on top of the filling, trimming the crust to 1-inch beyond the rim of the pie plate. Fold the top crust under the lower one and flute to form a ridge around the edge of the pie plate. Combine the egg yolk and water, then brush the mixture over the top crust and rim. Bake in a 400 degree F. oven for 45 to 50 minutes or until apples are tender and the crust is a golden brown. Cool on a wire rack until slightly warm and serve with Vanilla Ice Cream, if desired.</pr>

<pr>A candy thermometer is handy to have for this recipe to test the temperature of the syrup that binds the popcorn and nuts together. Mix popcorn and peanuts together in a large bowl or pan. Cook molasses and sugar together until the mixture reaches a temperature of 235 F on a candy thermometer. If you don't have a thermometer, test the syrup by letting some drop from a spoon into a cup of cold water. The syrup is done when it forms a thread as it drops into the water. Pour hot syrup mixture over the popcorn nut mixture and stir to coat evenly. Cool and break into chunks with a wooden spoon. Stored in an airtight container, mixture will keep well for 4 to 6 weeks.</pr>

<in>1/4 Sugar; granulated, or a little more</in>
<in>1 Egg; Large, separated, yolk lightly beaten</in>
<in>1/2 c Butter; softened, unsalted, not margarine</in>
<pr>Preheat the oven to 400 F. Working on a large flat surface, such as a pastry board, place the flour and the sugar in the center of the surface and mix together. Form a small depression or well in the center of the mound. Add the beaten egg yolk and the softened butter to the well, then blend these with the dry mixture. Mix the ingredients thoroughly using your hands (there's no substitute for warm hands). Shape the dough into a ball and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill for at least 10 minutes. Roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/4inch. You should have a circle of about 11 inches in diameter. For best results, roll out your dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper, then peel away the paper and cut the crust in a 9-inch circle. Place the circle inside a 9-inch spring-form pan. Prick the crust several times with a fork to keep the crust from puffing up during the baking. Place the spring-form pan in the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until light brown. Allow to cool. Using the leftover dough, line the sides of the spring-form pan. Press the dough against the sides of the pan, smoothing it so as to have a continuous layer of crust all the way around the sides of the pan. Make sure that the side crust meets the bottom crust all the way around. Brush the reserved egg white onto the shell, covering the bottom and sides. This will seal the dough and keep it from becoming soggy. Set aside until ready to use. For Italian Cheesecake, add 1 ts of grated lemon rind and 1 ts of Amaretto Liqueur when adding the egg yolk and butter.</pr>

With a pastry cutter, work flour and shortening together until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add ice water, little by little, pressing the pastry together into a ball.  Wrap and chill for at least 1 hour. If pastry has been chilled for a long time, let it sit at room temperature for at least 15 minutes before rolling. Lightly flour pastry board, marble counter or kitchen counter.  Divide pastry in half.  Pat each piece of pastry into a flat, round shape.  Lightly flour rolling pin.  Roll pastry in one direction only, turning pastry continually to prevent it from sticking to the surface. Using a pie plate as a guide, measure rolled-out pastry, it should be slightly larger than the pie plate and 1/8 inch (2 mm) thick.  Fold rolled pastry circle in half, so it can be lifted out more easily.  Unfold, gently fitting the pastry into the pie plate, allowing pastry to overhang the edges evenly.  Do not trim pastry yet.  Fill the pie with filling. Roll out the second crust in the same way.  Fold circle in half and with a sharp, pointed knife cut little vents in a decorative pattern.  Place folded pastry on one half of the pie.  Unfold, pressing top and bottom pastry together.  Trim edges with scissors, leaving a 1/2 inch (1 cm.) overhang.

Cover with the rest of the kibbee mixture and pat with moistened hands. With a knife dipped in cold water, cut a diamond pattern through the layers. Dot with the remaining butter. Bake for 10 minutes, then lower the heat to 325F. Bake for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until browned and bubbling. Do not overcook.  Serve hot with yogurt and salad. Instead of making if one big fat kibbee, you can make "meatballs." Take about 2 Tblsp of meat mixture and flatten in the palm of my hand. Then take about 12 tsp of filling and put that in the middle of the meat. Then take another 2 Tblsp of meat mixture, flatten and place over the meat with the  filling. Shape into ovalshaped meatballs. Bake the same way as above.</pr>

<in>2 cups pinhead Irish oatmeal</in>
<in>1 2/3 cups suet</in>
<in>salt and pepper</in>
<in>trussing needle and fine string</in>
<in>offal</in>
<ti>Cannoli</ti>
<in>FILLING:</in>
<in>1 1/2 cups whole milk ricotta cheese, well drained</in>
<in>3 tablespoons sugar</in>
<in>1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon</in>
<in>1 1/2 cups milk chocolate, chopped coarsely</in>
<in>1/4 cup pistachio nuts, chopped coarsely</in>
<in>DOUGH:</in>
<in>1 cup all-purpose flour</in>
<in>1 tablespoon sugar</in>
<in>1 tablespoon butter or lard</in>
<in>4 to 5 tablespoons sweet marsala wine or dry white wine</in>
<in>2 cups vegetable oil</in>
<in>colored sprinkles</in>
<in>confectioners sugar</in>
<pr>Thoroughly wash the stomach bag in cold water.  Turn it inside out and scald; scrape the surface with a knife.  Soak in cold, salted water overnight.  Next day remove the bag from the water and leave it on one side while preparing the filling.  Wash the pluck.  Put it into a pan, with the windpipe hanging over the side into a bowl, to let out any impurities.  Cover the pluck with cold water, add 1 teaspoon of salt and bring the water to the boil.  Skim the surface, then simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Parboil onions, drain, reserving the liquid, and chop them roughly. Toast the pinhead oatmeal until golden brown. Drain the pluck when ready; cut away windpipe and any excess gristle. Mince half the liver with all the heart, stir in shredded suet, toasted oatmeal and onions.  Season well with salt and pepper.  Moisten with as much of the onion or pluck water as necessary to make the mixture soft.  With the rough surface of the bag outside fill it just over half full, the oatmeal will swell during cooking, and sew the ends together with the trussing needle and fine string.  Prick the bag in places with the needle. Place the haggis on an enamel plate and put it into a pan of boiling water.  Cover pan and cook for about 3 hours, adding more boiling water, when necessary, to keep the haggis covered. In a bowl, combine all the filling ingredients and mix well.  Refrigerate, covered, until ready to fill the cannoli shells. To make the dough, place flour in a bowl or food processor.  Add butter or lard and sugar and mix with a fork, or pulse, until the mixture resembles coarse meal.  Slowly add 1/4 cup of wine and shape the mixture into a ball; add a little more wine if the dough appears too dry.  It should be soft, but not sticky. Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, for about 10 minutes.  Wrap dough and refrigerate for 45 minutes.  Place chilled dough on a floured, work surface.  Divide dough in half.  Work with 1 piece of dough at a time; keep the remaining dough refrigerated. Roll dough out to a very thin, long rectangle, about 14 inches long and 3 inches wide, either by hand or using a pasta machine set to the finest setting.  Cut dough into 3 inch squares.  Place a cannoli form diagonally across 1 square.  Roll the dough up around the form so the points meet in the center.  Seal the points with a little water.  Continue making cylinders until all dough is used. In electric skillet, heat vegetable oil to 375 F.  Fry cannoli, 3 or 4 at a time, turning as they brown and blister, until golden brown on all sides.  Drain on brown paper.  When cool enough to handle, carefully slide the cannoli off the forms.</pr>

<in>grated rind from 1 orange</in>
<in>1/2 lb. commercial filo sheets</in>

<in>SYRUP:</in>
<in>2 cups honey</in>
<in>1 cup water</in>
<in>2 cups sugar</in>
<in>1 tablespoon lemon juice</in>
<pr>Yield: 1 serving Defrost filo to room temperature, at least 2 hours before using. Mix filling in a bowl and set aside. Melt butter in a small pan, and return to heat when it cools and does not flow easily while you are working with filo. Smooth 3 sheets of filo flat on a cutting board.  With a pastry brush, dribble warm butter between sheets. Sprinkle 2/3 cup nut filling over top, spreading to the corners. Lay another 3 sheets of filo over filling, buttering between them.  Fold edges over on each side to stop nuts from rolling out.  Starting with the end nearest to you, roll away from you as tightly as you can.  Cut into 1 inch slices. Place each roll in an oiled pan, snugly next to each other, with the nuts facing upwards.  Continue using all the filo and filling. When all the slices are in the pan, dribble a teaspoon of warm butter on top of each slice.  It will disappear into the layers of nutmeats. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes. Begin making the syrup 20 minutes before the pastry is ready to be taken out of the oven. Pour hot syrup over rolls immediately upon removal from the oven.  Use a spoon to ladle syrup over each roll. Set aside for 4 hour so the rolls will absorb the syrup.  Do not refrigerate.</pr>

<in>1/2 lb Provolone, thinly sliced</in>

<in>1 Red bell pepper; roasted, peeled, seeded, and cut into 3" x 3/8" strips</in>
<in>1 sm Jar sun-dried tomatoes (packed in olive oil)</in>
<in>Fresh basil for garnish</in>
<pr>Mix cream cheese and butter with a fork; add pesto and mix well. Line a small (3cup) loaf pan or bowl with plastic wrap, leaving several inches of overhang on each side. Make a thin layer of provolone slices on the bottom and partially up the sides. Spread 1/3 of the pesto mixture over the cheese; artistically arrange 2 or 3 sun-dried tomatoes, 4 - 6 bell pepper strips, and about 1 tablespoon toasted pine nuts over the pesto. Repeat layers until all ingredients are used (reserving some of the pine nuts to sprinkle on top), pressing down well between layers. Chill overnight or for several days. Serve at room temperature on a platter wreathed with fresh basil sprigs. Additional toasted pine nuts, sun-dried tomatoes cut as flowers, bell pepper strips, and fresh basil sprigs may be used as garnish. Torta may be presented inverted or not. Keeps several weeks refrigerated. Although best served at room temperature, it slices best chilled. Looks nice served on a platter adorned with grape leaves and small clusters of red and white grapes. Use lemon pesto; substitute slivered toasted almonds for the pine nuts; omit the sun-dried tomatoes and add 1 teaspoon lemon zest to the cream cheese mixture. Use purple pesto; omit the red pepper if desired and increase the sun-dried tomatoes. Use cinnamon basil pesto; omit the sun-dried tomatoes and the red peppers if desired, and use pecans instead of pine nuts.</pr>

<ti>Never Fail Pastry Mix</ti>
<in>6 c Flour</in>
<in>1 tb Salt</in>
<in>1 lb Can of vegetable shortening</in>
<in>2 c Pastry mix</in>
<in>2 tb To 3; ice water</in>
<pr>TO MAKE MIX: Sift flour and salt together into a large bowl. Drop shortening into the mixture by spoonfuls and with a pastry blender or two knives,cut it into the flour mixture until the mixture is crumbly. Stop when the mixture still looks coarse - do not let it become smooth. If you know exactly how the mixture should look, you can do this in the food processor, but be careful not to over process. Store pastry mix in a tightly sealed container on pantry shelf in medium to cool weather for 1 to 3 months. If the weather is warm or humid, it is better to keep this in the refrigerator. Let it warm to room temperature and recrumble a bit if needed before using. TO USE: For a single pie crust you will need: 2 cups Pastry mix 2 to 3 tb ice water. Toss the mix and ice water gently unitl the mixture begins to stick together. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface - formica, marble or a cutting board and gently roll out a circle to fit your pie pan. Some people use a pastry cloth or a square of clean muslin to cover the surface they are working on. Roll the pastry out right on the cloth, and then lift the cloth and pastry, turn it upside down into the pan, and peel the cloth away. As you lift the dough into the pan, remember that tears can be repaired with a bit of water and a small piece of dough, or you could remove the holey inadequate crust, knead it back together and try again. The more you knead, however, the tougher the pie crust will become, so practice until you have a light sure touch. If you fear that you'll never get the hang of rolling out a pie crust that doesn't tear apart, you might try placing a ball of dough into a large size plastic bag and roll the dough while it is still in the bag. When it is the right size, cut open the bag, remove the top sheet, flip the dough into your pan and remove the bottom sheet.</pr>

<ti>Jane's Hushpuppies (Florida Cooking)</ti>
<in>1 c Self-rising corn meal (preferably white stone ground)</in>
<in>1/2 c Self-rising flour</in>
<in>1/4 c Pancake mix (see note)</in>
<in>Pinch salt</in>
<in>1/2 ts Sugar</in>
<in>1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper</in>
<in>1 Egg</in>
<in>1 md Onion, diced</in>
<in>1/2 c Milk, or as needed</in>
<in>Oil or fish drippings for frying</in>
<pr>Hushpuppies are fried in hot drippings left after frying fish, picking up some of the fresh fish flavor. Combine the corn meal, flour, pancake mix, salt, sugar, and pepper in a bowl. Beat the egg lightly in a measuring cup, and add the onion and enough milk to fill to the 1cup mark. Mix the liquids into the dry mixture well. If not moist throughout, add a tablespoonful or two more of milk, blending well. Put any fish drippings you may have in a heavy frying pan and add enough oil to a depth of 1/4 inch. Heat and drop a small amount of batter into the fat. If it sizzles, the fat is hot enough. Make a test hushpuppy: Drop a teaspoonful of batter in; if it spreads like a pancake, the batter is too thin, so stir a tablespoonful or two of corn meal into the uncooked batter. If, after the test hushpuppy has cooked, it is dense and dry, stir 2 or 3 ts of milk into the batter. When the batter consistency is right, drop the batter from the tip of a teaspoon into the pan; cook 6, 8, or 10 at a time, being careful not to let the hushpuppies overlap while frying. Cook until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes, turn, and brown the other side, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels and keep hot while frying the remaining hushpuppies. Add more oil to the pan as needed, a little at a time, to prevent cooking. Fat should be kept medium-hot, to brown hushpuppies. Check often so that hushpuppies do not scorch. In Florida many like to use self-rising flour and corn meal as well as pancake mix in hushpuppies and other breads. If you wish, substitute all-purpose flour for self-rising and the pancake mix; use plain corn meal in place of the self-rising type. Then to the dry ingredients add 1 tbs baking powder and 1 ts salt. Add the liquid ingredients, then proceed as directed.</pr>

<in>2 lg Garlic cloves; chopped</in>
<in>1 c Raw longgrain rice</in>
<in>1 bn Fresh dill; chopped</in>
<in>1/2 bn Fresh parsley; chopped</in>
<in>1 1/2 Lemons (or more), juice only</in>
<in>Salt and freshly ground pepper</in>
<in>1 c Hot water</in>
<in>1 lb Jar grapevine leaves</in>
<pr>Heat the 1/2 cup oil in a skillet. Add the onion and scallions and saute for about 5 min, until soft and transparent.  Add the garlic and cook for a few minutes, then add the rice, dill, parsley, lemon  juice, salt, pepper, and remaining 1/4 cup olive oil. Stir well, then add the hot water. Cover and simmer about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool. Meanwhile, carefully remove the grapevine leaves from the jar, leaving the brine in  the jar. Wash grapevine leaves thoroughly and drain, then with a sharp knife cut  the heavy stems from the leaves. (If using fresh grapevine leaves use the same  procedure, parboiling leaves for 5 minutes when not tender, then drain.) Line an enameled pan with a few heavy grapevine leaves and set aside. To stuff a grapevine leaf, put it on your working surface rough side up and stem  end near you, and place a teaspoonful of the rice mixture near the stem end. Using both hands, fold the part of the leaf near you up and over the filling. Then fold the right side of the leaf over the filling, then the left side, and roll  tightly and back away from you and toward the pointed end of leaf. Place the "dolma", seam side down, in the prepared pan. Continue stuffing grapevine leaves until the mixture has been used. (If any grapevine leaves remain, replace in the reserved brine for future use.)  Place an inverted plate on the dolmades, and add enough water to cover the dolmades  (about 1 to 11/2 cups). Bring to a boil, then cover the pan, lower the heat, and  simmer as slowly as possible for 11/4 hours, then taste one to see if the rice is  tender, and continue cooking slowly if necessary. Cool, then chill. Serve cold, as an appetizer or as an entree. An important variation, particularly in Macedonia and Thrace: add a few tablespoons  of raisins and pine nuts to the filling when adding the rice. You may vary the size of dolmades as you wish by adding 11/2 tsp of the filling.  However, be consistent to allow them to cook at the same rate. They may be stored in the refrigerator for a week or so.</pr>

<ti>Tofu</ti>
<in>2 cups washed soy beans, preferably a large, low oil variety</in>
<in>6 quarts boiling water</in>
<pr>Cover beans with water and let soak for a few hours until the beans, when split, have flat surfaces and break easily.  They will have a pale color throughout if there are sunken yellow spots, soak longer.  Do not undersoak the beans, and do not let ferment (indicated by bubbles rising to the top) or the results will not be as good.  Drain beans. Bring 6 quarts of water to the boil in one pan or kettle, and another 16 quarts to the boil in a large, deep pan.  Turn off heat.  Blend 1 cup beans with 1 1/2 cups boiling water from the smaller pan until well blended.  The resulting mixture will resemble wet cream of wheat.  Continue to blend the beans, 1 cup at a time, and add the mixture to the water in the large pan.  Stir. Line a large colander with tofu bag, moistened with water, and place it on a rack over another large pan.  Pour the contents from the large pan into the tofu bag and drain, pressing it to squeeze out all the soy milk.  You now have soy milk and okra.  Set the okra aside or freeze for later use. Simmer soy milk over a medium to low heat.  This will take awhile.  Stirring will increase the heating process.  Boil for 7 minutes.  If there is a good "skim" on the top, remove with a chopstick.  This is called "Yuba" and is used in the Orient as a meat substitute.  Fried up in a little butter or oil it tastes like chicken skin. COAGULANT:  Combine 2 teaspoons Epsom salts in 1 cup warm water, or 2 tablespoons of nigari in 1 cup warm water, or 2 tablespoons lemon juice in 1 cup warm water.  Take the soy milk off the heat and sprinkle 1/2 the coagulant gently over the soy milk.  Cut through, but do not stir the soy milk, to distribute the coagulant.  Let stand for a few minutes.  Curds should begin to form.  Sprinkle 1/2 the remaining coagulant in the same manner.  Repeat as needed (you may need to mix up more solution) until there are white curds in pale yellow whey and no creaminess remaining. Place the pressing box on a rack over a large pan, line with a moistened cloth.  Drain off whey from curds without disturbing too much.  Gently ladle the curds into the pressing box.  Cover the tofu (that is what is in the box) with the cloth, put a board or plate on top and weight it down with a 35 pound weight for 20 minutes. Submerge the cloth-wrapped tofu in cool water, remove the cloth.  Store tofu in water in the refrigerator, change water daily, or freeze it for an interesting texture change.  It takes awhile, but the end result will be a couple of pounds of the best tofu you have ever eaten, a gallon or more of okra, and a couple gallons of whey all for the cost of 2 cups of soy beans.</pr>
